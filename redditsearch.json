Artisans are all priced at retail or what i got them for aftermarket to my best knowledge. If its not listed here and you saw it in an older post of mine thats because A. I sold it to friends already, or B. That item will remain trade only. This thread is only for sales. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShipping is included for CONUS, Canada is +$4, INTL is $10. **ARTISANS ARE NOT FCFS. Priority goes to friends, bundles, people who are trying to complete a build (and can prove it), and then first come**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nArtisan stamp: https://imgur.com/pmIkgm6\n\nGrab Bag Stamp: https://imgur.com/GMJ7gEb\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGrab bags are mainly from recent ones, with some leftover keys from other older grab bags. There are over 2+ grab bags here, i think i maybe took out 15 blank keys I wanted to use for molds. Broke them down into SA, SA Carbon, and DSA. No i will not be sorting them and telling you all the keys or looking for x and x size or novelty. I dont feel like going through and sorting everything. As I said these are basically untouched aside from me taking some blanks out.\n\nGrab Bag | Available | Description | What I Want |\n---------|----------|----------|----------------\nSA Carbon Bag | Yes | SA carbon keys | $55 \nSA Grab Bag | Yes | SA keys besides SA Carbon | $75\nEverything else | Yes | Every other profile that came in the bags besides SA | $45\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nArtisan/keys | Available | Description | What I Want |\n---------|----------|----------|----------------\nHWS Switch Doctor Up Peep Creek | Yes | | $65\nHWS Otter Alpine 4U | Yes | | $55\nHWS Earl Esc Princess Trick | Yes | | $55\nSUK Snapper custom painted by KeyPressGraphics Chocolatier colorway | Yes | has a very tiny nick on one of the shell spikes | $150\nSUK Graphene Snapper | Yes | | $80\nSUK Patriarch Freedom Fighter (TMX) | Yes | | $70\nAlpha Cherep Mystery Colorway | Yes | | $65\nArtKey Jack Bald Harvey | Yes | | $45\nArtKey Jack Bald Xmas Cyan | Yes | | $50\nArtKey Jack Bald Xmas Red | Yes | | $50\nSimulacra Bonerider Molten | Yes | | $55\nRAMA A1 SA Moon | Yes | | $45\nRAMA A1 SA Moon | Yes | | $45\nRAMA A1 SA Corona | Yes | | $45\nRAMA A1 SA Corona | Yes | | $45\nRAMA A1 SA Corona | Yes | | $45\nRAMA A1 SA Corona | Yes | | $45\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThanks for stopping by to check out my sale!",
